			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the Settings tab it is possible to customize the application.
			<br>In particular, the following can be adapted:
			<ul>
				<li>The appearance (the theme) of the programs's graphical environment.</li>
				<li>Display the border of the <em> window (on topics that support this feature)</em>.</li>
				<li>Saves the window dimensions when they are modified by the user.</li>
				<li>Reset the dimensions to the default.</li>
				<li>Save the window position when it is modified by the user.</li>
				<li>Reset the window to the default location.</li>				
			</ul>

			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The architecture of the Swing Graphic Environment allows you to customize the appearance of its elements.
			<br>So, in addition to Java's default theme, Metal, it is possible to apply modified versions of this topic, but also to scenes that resemble graphic environments, of various operating systems.
			<br>Specifically, Sun in the JVM that it distributes has so far included environments:
			<dl>
				<dt>Motif</dt>
				<dd>The full name of the environment is CDE/Motif, which is designed for UNIX operating systems.
				Specifically, it simulates OSF/1 Motif 1.2.5, which comes with Sun's Solaris 2.6 operating system.</dd>
				<dt><br>Gtk</dt>
				<dd>Environment based on the GTK + 2 Open Source Library "The GIMP Toolkit".
				<br>In the same library is based the <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Enviroment">GNOME</acronym>. One of the most popular integrated support frameworks for the Linux X-Windows system.
				For this reason the behavior of this subject is similar to  <acronym title="GNU Network Object Model Enviroment">GNOME</acronym>
				</dd>				
				<dt><br>MS Windows</dt>
				<dd>Microsoft Windows environment. From the versions <acronym title="Java Virtual Machine">JVM</acronym> 1.4.2 + also supports the themable Microsoft Windows XP environment.</dd>
				<dt><br>Mac OS X</dt>
				<dd>Apple's operating system environment.
				<em>only supported on machines running Mac OS.</em></dd>
			</dl>
			Some of the above themes may not be supported by JVM, which you have on your system.
			<br>If you try to apply such a theme, you will receive the relevant notification and will automatically apply the native theme of your system.

		<p>
			<font color="#000000" size="5">Apply a theme to the border</font><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swing's 'native' environment, Metal, supports its application in the outline and title bar of the application window. This creates a uniform environment independent of the operating system.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This technique can not be applied to the issues described above that resemble famous operating system environments.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you have applied such a theme to your application selection box and the outline will be inactive.
			<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In order to apply the theme and the outline, the app's graphical environment must be restarted.

			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The application environment, through the layout administrators it uses, allows the user to adjust the window dimensions as needed. With this option turned on, the application window, each time it starts, will have the dimensions the user gave it the last time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#000000" size="5">Reset size</font><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clicking the 'Reset' button, located next to the box above, the window dimensions are reset to factory default.

			<font color="#000000" size="5">Save location change</font><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With this option turned on, the application window, each time it starts, is displayed in the location where the user left it the last time.
		</p>
		<p>
			<font color="#000000" size="5">Reset size</font><br>
			&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By clicking the 'Reset' button, located next to the selection box above, the window is reset to the default location specified by the manufacturer.
